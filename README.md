# GeoAutomation Scripts

This repository contains 3 simple automation scripts for geospatial processing:

1. `clip_with_arcpy.py` – Clips one shapefile using another (ArcPy required).
2. `transform_coordinates_pyproj.py` – Converts WGS84 lat/lon to UTM using PyProj.
3. `buffer_with_shapely.py` – Creates a 1 km buffer around a geographic point using Shapely.
4. `dissolve_with_arcpy.py`: Dissolves polygons based on a field using ArcPy.
5. `reproject_shapefile_pyproj.py`: Reprojects a shapefile from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 using PyProj and PyShp.
6. `intersect_with_shapely.py`: Computes intersection area between two polygons using Shapely.

## Requirements
- ArcPy (ArcGIS)
- pyproj
- shapely

## Usage
Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.
